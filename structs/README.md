# Playing with Structs

Structs are an immensely powerful object type that I use quite often in Go. They allow you to perform object oriented programming, which can simplify the usage of your code for the caller of the object. Additionally, you can perform functions specifically per object which can come in handy when you're setting up multiple objects.

Most of the documentation here is in the `playingWithStructs.go` file, so view the comments there.
