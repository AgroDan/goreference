# Web Requests

In my mind, Python really is the best language for just arbitrary web requests. The `Requests` package is incredibly easy to grok, at least for me anyway. Go's method is a little bit more...involved. But honestly, it's not that bad. You have to keep in mind the standard Go-isms such as working with buffers and the like, but all in all it's manageable.
