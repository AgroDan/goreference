In Go's bright land where code runs lean,
A language born for speed unseen,
With goroutines like rivers flow,
Concurrency, the heartbeats grow.
No tangled web of syntax strange,
In Go, simplicity's the range.
With structs and types in clear array,
Building strong foundations day by day.
A golden gopher, bold and bright,
In Go's embrace, code takes its flight.
